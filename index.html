      <!-- if we uncomment this heading then firstly it will load n then in milliseconds render method will replace it with react element we created. This is happening because script tag will come after this heading -->

    <!-- putting these headings around root div tells that react only works on root element(which we created using createRoot, the name of id can be anything but it will work on that). -->
    <!-- So because of this we can use react in a portion of an app. So that's why it's not a full fledged framework but a library of javascript -->

Using a domain name to identify a location on the Internet rather than the numeric IP address makes it much easier to remember and type web addresses. -->
